    <h1>Lionel Messi</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Lionel Andrés Messi</strong> also known as <strong>Leo Messi</strong>, is an Argentine professional
        footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team.
        Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,
        Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden
        Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team.
        Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a
        club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions
        Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474),
        a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8),
        and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the record for
        most international goals by a South American male (81). Messi has scored over 750 senior career goals for club
        and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club.
        <br><br>
        Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his
        competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the
        next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble
        in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed,
        with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times and in
        a row.[10] During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single
        season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished
        second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form
        during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic
        second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in
        2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in
        August 2021.

        An Argentine international, Messi is both his country's highest appearance-maker and their all-time leading
        goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both
        the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a
        diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his
        successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a
        FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the
        tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA
        World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball in the
        2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his
        country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and won the
        2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would
        see him receive a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021.
        <br><br>
        Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's
        highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid
        athlete by Forbes in 2019. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In
        February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and
        the first team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer (and second
        team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.
